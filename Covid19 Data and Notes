Data that we need as inputs - Tianai, Erin, Ry
 
	I think some numbered points have a higher “impact level” than the others, so you can choose the ones that you think would influence the model more to work with first.

 Things we need to know about a 'person':

1. 	Age distribution --> Obtain data on distribution of ages in the population

(ctrl-F to find keywords, e.g. age, in the document)
 
2. 	Whether is admitted to hospital --> Look data on how sick you get as function of age and whether that leads to hospitalization, and ICU and ventilation.

3. 	Add some sort of geography to include the fact that you're more likely to be infected in a particular location (long term care, hospital, grocery store, etc.)

-   	 
 
4. 	Add some mechanism to be infected through a surface, rather than contact from a person
-   	Shopping carts, door handles, bus handles… (though these are also the surfaces that are being disinfected the most, so need to look into this, hopefully find credible research/papers on this matter)
-   	 
 
5. 	Whether the person uses public transit (look up data on public transit use), include infection mechanism through air/surface in public transit (and grocery stores, etc)
 
6. 	Whether a person is more/less likely to spread because they use (or not) PPE, perhaps look at how that changes with time

https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/covid-wwksf/what-we-know-public-masks-apr-7-2020.pdf?la=en
 
7. 	Has symptoms? --> include in the model that someone with symptoms likely has less contacts
 
8. 	Job -> Take into account if person is essential worker in terms of how many contacts they may have, look up data on number of essential workers

9. 	Possibility/probability of being reinfected --> Look up data on duration of infection, infection with no symptoms https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/info/ppih/if-ppih-covid-19-reinfection-rapid-review.pdf
It is expected that those who had covid-19 won’t be able to get it a second time although it has not been experimentally proven. 
10.	How susceptible an individual might be to get sick, contagious, etc (pre-existing conditions)
 
11.	How symptomatic a person might be (e.g. younger people less symptomatic, spread it more)
 
12.  Ability to quarantine people away from the population if they (tested positive, had symptoms, travelled)
13.	Distribution of people that travel
14.	Add testing (probability of being tested likely depends on your symptoms, which depends on your age). The more people are tested, likely the more people are quarantined --> Look up data on who is getting tested
15.	Include aspects of testing inaccuracies --> Look up data on testing accuracy
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-covid-19-antibody-tests-can-and-cannot-tell-us/

16.	Include PPE measures for health care workers
17.	Effects of public health measures (working from home, limited gathering, impositions on personal freedom)

Quarantine has reduced interactions from an average of 2 people per to 1. 
 
Properties of the virus:
SARS-COV-2 has very similar properties to SARS-COv - any information about properties of virus that is still unknown could be approximated by information about SARS-COV?

1.   	Look up incubation period, when you become infectious, whether you’re infectious with/without symptoms
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/
 
2.   	Contagion based on viral load --> Is there data on viral load distribution, does it make you more contagious?
3.   	Lethality, etc
