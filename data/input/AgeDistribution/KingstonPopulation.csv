Notes:
1, 2016 and 2011 population
,Statistics Canada is committed to protect the privacy of all Canadians and the confidentiality of the data they provide to us. As part of this commitment  some population counts of geographic areas are adjusted in order to ensure confidentiality.
,The adjustment to counts of the total population for any dissemination block is controlled to ensure that the population counts for dissemination areas will always be within 5 of the actual values. The adjustment has no impact on the population counts of census divisions and large census subdivisions.
2, Total private dwellings
,'Private dwelling' refers to a separate set of living quarters with a private entrance either from outside the building or from a common hall  lobby  vestibule or stairway inside the building. The entrance to the dwelling must be one that can be used without passing through the living quarters of some other person or group of persons.
,For more information  refer to the Census Dictionary: Private dwelling.
